# mini-calender

The calendar displays the current date, day, month, and year, all presented in a clean and visually appealing design. Users can see a gradient background that enhances the interface, as well as a structured layout that nicely separates the date information into two columns. The JavaScript functionality ensures that the calendar dynamically updates to reflect the correct current date and provides a seamless user experience.
